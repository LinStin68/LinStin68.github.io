    <h3> Greetings!</h3> 
    <p>I am Linda Stinson and I live in New London, MO. I work for the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in Jefferson City, MO through the Office of College and Career Readiness. My position is a supervisor for the Skilled Technical Sciences department, which I have really enjoyed for the past two years.
My previous experience includes teaching Family Consumer Science for 14.5 years, serving as a Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA) and ProStart advisor. During this time I took students to state and national competitions.

I have one awesome daughter, Jessica Stinson. She is a rising third year and attends The University of Chicago in Hyde Park, and is often proof-reading my work.
 
Outside of work I am also a cat mom. My favorite cat is my rescue cat, Rummi. She is a bit sassy at times, but we have a special bond.</p>
