    <h3> A Little About Me</h3> 
    
    <p>Greetings! I am Linda Stinson and I live in New London, MO. I work for the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in Jefferson City, MO through the Office of College and Career Readiness. My position is a supervisor for the Skilled Technical Sciences department, which I have really enjoyed for the past two years.

    My previous experience includes teaching Family Consumer Science for 14.5 years, serving as a Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA) and ProStart advisor. I left the classroom for a change and desire to help other educators.
    
    I am currently pursuing my Education Specialist Degree in Learning Technologies and Design from the University of Missouri School of Information Science and Learning Technologies. I plan to graduate in May of 2022. My goal is to receive my doctorate degree. I look forward to the opportunities that await with my pursuit of higher education.</p>
    
    
    <blockquote> <q>I am very passionate about Career Technical Education and what it has to offer.</q></blockquote>
    
    <p>Masters Degree in Education - Quincy University</p>
    <p>Bachelor of Arts Family Consumer Science - College of the Ozarks</p>
