                    <p cclass="project-text"> For my digital media class I created a google site revolving around a central theme. The theme I chose was my cat, Rummi. Utilizing Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator I created a pdf for My Time with Rummi. Adobe Premier was used to create my video “Kitty Cocoa Time.” The audio recording was made using Adobe Audio. I feel these pieces represent a multi-faceted aspect of using digital media effectively within a theme. This experience and techniques learned can be applied to many future projects. My attention to detail and quality products are a result of hard work and time.

                <p> MiZoomi was a group project for an Instructional Systems Design Project. MiZoomi was created to teach new educators how to use Zoom for their classrooms. Our project design was set up to provide training for educators that come straight out of industry into the classroom. Many of these educators have 6,000 work experience in a related field to what they are teaching. We created a three day workshop for the training.
                    The instructional design project included Goals, Needs and Task Analysis, Formative and Summative Evaluation, Learner and Contextual Analysis, Types of Learning Experiences, Materials, and Implementation Plan and Schedule.</p>

                <p>Based upon my research paper “What Are the Marketing Preferences for Secondary Career Technical Education Programs?” I submitted a proposal to present my findings. I submitted the proposal to the National Association of Career Technical Education (ACTE) Vision Conference. The conference will be held in New Orleans December 1-4, 2021. My presentation proposal was accepted and the date of my presentation is pending. The proposal was based on marketing preferences and marketing research for Career Technical Education, including marketing apprenticeship programs, industry recognized credentials, and dual credits. Parents and students want to know and learn about real world experiences.
