<h3> Greetings!</h3>

    <h1>Welcome to Linda Stinson's Website</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my portfolio. Please explore and learn about me.</h2>

    <p>I am Linda Stinson and I live in New London, MO. I work for the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in Jefferson City, MO through the Office of College and Career Readiness. My position is a supervisor for the Skilled Technical Sciences department, which I have really enjoyed for the past two years.</p>
    <p>My previous experience includes teaching Family Consumer Science for 14.5 years, serving as a Family, Career and Community Leaders of America (FCCLA) and ProStart advisor. During this time I took students to state and national competitions.</p>

    <p>I have one awesome daughter, Jessica Stinson. She is a rising third year and attends The University of Chicago in Hyde Park, and is often proof-reading my work.</p>
 
    <p>Outside of work I am also a cat mom. My favorite cat is my rescue cat, Rummi. She is a bit sassy at times, but we have a special bond.</p>


 
    <p>The purpose of this website is to showcase my work created while earning my Education Specialist Degree in Learning Technologies and Design from the University of Missouri in the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies. My goal while in this program is to give my best and strive to learn as much as I can. My desire is that this will show in the work I am showcasing here. I want viewers of my website to evaluate the in-depth learning and knowledge I have attained from this program. By viewing my website you will learn more about me. Feel free to explore samples of my projects and experiences. I am certain you will discover attention to detail and my ability to provide a quality finished product. Although my background is in Career Technical Education I have the flexibility to apply instructional design to many subjects, including my cat Rummi.</p>
