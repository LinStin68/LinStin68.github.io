 <h3> Real World Experience Philosophy </h3>
</header>

<div>
    <p class="intro"> After teaching in the classroom for 14.5 years I was ready for a change. My love of Career Technical Education and desire to help other educators landed me at the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in Jefferson City, MO. I work in the Office of College and Career Readiness. I love career technical education and what it has to offer students.</p>
 
    <p class="indent">My philosophy includes hands-on real world experience. This is one of the greatest ways to teach people of all ages. Relevance of learning and practical application. Providing students with apprenticeship and experience in the industry is critical for the survival of many programs. Nations all over the world are facing a skilled workforce shortage. Educators and administrators can play a major role in meeting the demand for quality workers.</p>
 
    <p class="indent">My experience in the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies program through the University of Missouri has been exceptional. I am amazed by the knowledge and experiences I am presented with each semester. I look forward to my classes and what I will learn next. </p>

    <p class="indent">My career goal is to earn my doctorate degree and see where life takes me.</p>
