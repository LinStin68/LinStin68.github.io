            <h3 class="title">Real World and Hands-On Experience</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="intro"> After teaching in the classroom for 14.5 years I was ready for a change. My love of Career Technical Education and desire to help other educators landed me at the Missouri Department of Elementary and Secondary Education in Jefferson City, MO. I work in the Office of College and Career Readiness, Skilled Technical Science division.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I feel students learn best when hands-on learning is incorporated into the classroom. This is one of the greatest ways to teach people of all ages. Providing real world experiences to students helps them prepare for life outside of high school. I feel our programs must strive to incorporate business partnerships in order to thrive in the future. Providing students with apprenticeship and experience in the industry is critical for the survival of many programs. Nations all over the world are facing a skilled workforce shortage. Educators and administrators can play a major role in meeting the demand for quality workers.</p>
                <br>   
                <p>My experience in the School of Information Science and Learning Technologies program through the University of Missouri has been exceptional. I am amazed by the knowledge and experiences I am presented with each semester. I look forward to my classes and what I will learn next.</p>
                <br>   
                <p>My goal is to earn my doctorate degree. I believe we should all be lifelong learners. Constantly striving to improve and expand our knowledge. I also feel that continuing my education will open me up to more possibilities for my career. While I am not certain of my career path, I am certain that I have enjoyed the journey of earning my Education Specialist Degree from the University of Missouri, School of Information and Learning Technologies program.</p>
